  How do I know if the maximum amount is already being withheld?
content: |
  If your paycheck is already being garnished when you and/or your employer got this Writ of Garnishment for something other than child support, no more than 25% of your disposable earnings can be garnished.

  Your disposable earnings are money you get after legally required deductions from your paycheck. Legally required deductions are taxes and social security payments. They are not deductions for medical insurance, pension plans, life insurance, or employee savings plans.

  If the garnishment is to pay child support, up to 50% of your disposable earnings can be garnished. If it is for support payments that are more than 12 weeks late, 55% of your disposable earnings can be garnished. If you don't have other children or dependents, the garnishment could be for 60% of your disposable earnings; 65% if you're more than 12 weeks behind.

  If your pay is already being garnished for the maximum amount, this creditor cannot garnish more until after the other one expires or is fully paid.

id: writ_is_invalid
question: |
  The Writ of Garnishment is not properly issued if there's an error or mistake in the writ or the way it was issued.
subquestion: |
  For example, a writ was not properly issued if it was issued based on false information. 

  A garnishment could be invalid if, for example, the interest, costs, or judgment amount are inaccurate. The garnishment is also invalid if it is expired. A periodic garnishment expires 182 days after it was issued. A nonperiodic garnishment expires 91 days after it was issued.
